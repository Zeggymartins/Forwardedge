SECRET ADMIN SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
========================================

## STEP 1: ADD TO YOUR .ENV FILE

Add these two lines to your .env file:

ADMIN_SECRET_SETUP_KEY=your-secret-key-here-change-this-to-something-random
ADMIN_SECRET_SETUP_PATH=your-custom-secret-path-here

Example:
ADMIN_SECRET_SETUP_KEY=xK9mP2nQ5rT8wZ3vB6cE1dF4gH7jL0sA
ADMIN_SECRET_SETUP_PATH=my-secret-admin-panel-xk9p

IMPORTANT:
- Change both values to something unique and hard to guess
- Keep the SECRET_KEY safe - you'll need it to access the setup page
- The SECRET_PATH should be hard to guess (don't use common words like "admin-setup")

## STEP 2: ACCESS THE SECRET SETUP PAGE

Visit: https://forwardedgeconsulting.com/your-custom-secret-path-here

Example: https://forwardedgeconsulting.com/my-secret-admin-panel-xk9p

## STEP 3: FILL IN THE FORM

You'll see a secure form asking for:

1. Secret Key - Enter the ADMIN_SECRET_SETUP_KEY from your .env
2. Admin Name - Your full name
3. Admin Email - Your email address
4. New Password - Choose a strong password (min 8 characters)
5. Confirm Password - Re-enter the password

## STEP 4: SUBMIT

Click "Update Admin Credentials" or "Create Admin Account"

The system will:
- Create the admin account if none exists
- Update the existing admin credentials if one exists
- Automatically demote any other users who tried to become admin

## SECURITY FEATURES

✓ Only ONE admin can exist at any time
✓ Secret URL path protects against unauthorized access
✓ Secret key required to make changes
✓ Users cannot promote themselves to admin through normal registration
✓ Any attempt to create a second admin will automatically fail

## HOW TO CHANGE ADMIN PASSWORD LATER

1. Visit the same secret URL
2. Enter the secret key
3. Fill in new admin details
4. Submit - the current admin will be updated

## NOTES

- This page is NOT accessible through normal navigation
- Only you should know the secret URL and secret key
- Never share these credentials
- The secret URL won't appear in any logs or analytics
